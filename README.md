# Quakedet
It is a ongoing project where we are building an mobile application which will present the earthquake related of a particular location based on inputs fed by the user.
The inputs can:
1) Latitude
2) Longitude
3) Magnitude etc.

This will also be  making predictions of the magnitude of the earthquake which is possible to take place in a location.
Using the inputed seismic data of a location one of model will be able predict the time left for the earthquake to happen.(Its progress is still ongoing)
